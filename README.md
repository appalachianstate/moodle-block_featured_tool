# Featured tool #

Featured tool is a Moodle block plugin that allows admins to easily display information/announcements to teachers.

The featured tool can be configured to cycle between multiple sets of information. Admins can enter a subtitle, thumbnail, and the content to display to the users when they click on a button. There are currently three tools to hold this information, and the featured tool will decide which to show randomly any time the dashboard is loaded.

## Installing via uploaded ZIP file ##

1. Log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to _Site administration >
   Plugins > Install plugins_.
2. Upload the ZIP file with the plugin code. You should only be prompted to add
   extra details if your plugin type is not automatically detected.
3. Check the plugin validation report and finish the installation.

## Installing manually ##

The plugin can be also installed by putting the contents of this directory to

    {your/moodle/dirroot}/blocks/featured_tool

Afterwards, log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to _Site administration >
Notifications_ to complete the installation.

Alternatively, you can run

    $ php admin/cli/upgrade.php

to complete the installation from the command line.
